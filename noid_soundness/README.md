# Parano1d soundness certificate

`noid_soundness` instantiates the security analysis for the current Parano1d
production proof profile. Protocol constants are imported from the crates used
by the prover and verifier. Cross-component invariants and security inequalities
are evaluated with arbitrary-precision integer or rational arithmetic.

| Complete ideal bound at the Category 1 envelope | **0.049330348228363684** |

The first three rows use the classical random-oracle definitions and integer
presentation of Block and Tiwari. The remaining rows concern a different game:
acceptance of an invalid terminal State whose ancestry starts at genesis by a
quantum adversary.

`C1` is the source identifier for the production wide-challenge profile. Its
algebraic challenges are elements of `GF(2^256)`, sampled uniformly from a
trace-one affine set of cardinality `2^255`. In the security statement,
Category 1 is the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography resource target referenced to
exhaustive key search against AES-128, including the NIST `MAXDEPTH` limits. The
resource theorem, not the profile name, establishes the assessment.

The fixed Poseidon2b production conclusions are explicit implications:

```text
at T = 2^64:
    Delta_P2b < 0.312471062061564258

at the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Category 1 resource envelope:
    Delta_P2b^C1 < 0.450669651771636316
```

The Category 1 result states a batch gate-depth price and minimum scalar gate
charge used to translate oracle queries into logical circuit resources. These
conditions are part of the theorem. Faster circuits may use more gates; a
reference-depth factor is not a universal minimum depth. The separately
audited [complete constructions and scalar lower bound](docs/response-accounting.md)
are not substituted for those declared prices.

The [wallet Johnson refinement](docs/wallet-johnson.md) analyzes the same W65
protocol at radius `4/5`. It changes only the analysis and its executable
ledgers, not proof bytes, queries, circuit matrices, or consensus. The local
wallet query term improves, but History becomes the limiting Category 1 event;
the overall main-term resource floor improves by about `0.1172` bits. The
classical FS-FRI and sequential ideal-QROM results are unchanged.

The certificate also instantiates published algebraic cryptanalysis
of Poseidon2b. The wide tensor round skips in ePrint 2026/306 do not apply to
the production width-four permutation. Appendix A does apply to the MDS
two-to-one feed-forward compression used by production Merkle trees. For the
source-linked `GF(2^128)`, `t=4`, `x^7`, `RF=8`, `RP=58` instance, Theorem 5.1
gives

```text
round skip                 (1, [1, 7])
ideal-degree upper bound   7^73
log2(d_I^2) dedicated algebraic projection   409.873818620410
```

The final value is the paper's classical dedicated-attack projection with
`omega=2`, derived from an ideal-degree upper bound. The fixed-Poseidon2b QROM
delta remains the separate premise stated by the end-to-end theorem. The exact
correspondence and its scope are included in [the Category 1
proof](docs/category-one.md#current-poseidon2b-cryptanalysis).

The certificate also instantiates the August 2026 nonlinear-subspace models
from ePrint 2026/1792. It checks the required balancing rank against the exact
production internal matrix over `GF(2^128)`, obtaining `N_e=0xbe32`. The
production constraint budget is `E_c=2`, so the new trail covers four of 58
partial rounds. The smallest attack-cost projection in that comparison is
`1022.830074998558` bits under its `omega=2` semi-regular Macaulay model. It is
therefore weaker than the existing ePrint 2026/306 feed-forward projection and
does not change the certificate conclusion. It is an attack-model projection,
not a claim of 1022-bit security. The full calculation and scope are in the
[August 2026 Poseidon2b review](docs/poseidon2b-august-2026.md).

## Block–Tiwari comparison

Block and Tiwari define concrete FS-FRI security as the minimum expected
classical random-oracle query work over every positive integer query budget.
Their published comparison and the production Parano1d row are:

| Organization | Repository or configuration | Target | Provable | Conjectured |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Polygon | Plonky2 | 100 | 38 | 99 |
| StarkWare | stone-prover | 96 | 54 | 99 |
| StarkWare | SHARP Verifier | 96 | 59 | 95 |
| dYdX | dYdX Protocol | 80 | 52 | 79 |
| Polygon Miden | Miden-VM | 96 / 128 | 45 / 67 | 96 / 128 |
| Lambda Class | lambdaworks | 80 / 100 / 128 | 81 / 99 / 127 | 81 / 101 / 129 |
| RISC Zero | RISC Zero | 100 | 37 | 99 |
| Matter Labs | era-boojum | 100 | 50 | 99 |
| **Parano1d** | History B25 / B255 | **128** | **127** | **127** |

Both Parano1d values lie in the exact interval `[127, 128)`. Their whole-bit
values are equal because the 256-bit random-oracle collision term controls the
minimum expected-work scale in both calculations. The descriptive logarithms
of the two exact rational work values are different:

```text
provable    127.194502224322
conjectured 127.207518749639
```

See [the full calculation](docs/block-tiwari.md) for the metric, local RBR
premises, exact optimizer and primary sources.

## Certification basis

`ProductionParameters::load` constructs the analysis parameter tuple from the
wallet soundness ledger, wallet geometry, both canonical History PCS profiles,
the BaseFold query count, the wide-challenge support and the fixed Poseidon2b
profile. Construction fails unless the cross-component equalities required by
the reductions hold.

The documents define the security games, identify the applicable published
theorems and derive every Parano1d-specific term. Separate Rust types preserve
the distinction between the Block–Tiwari, sequential QROM and depth-aware
Category 1 statements. Probabilities, optimizer boundaries and resource
inequalities are evaluated with arbitrary-size integers and reduced rational
numbers. Floating point is confined to descriptive logarithms. Upper bounds
are rounded upward and sufficient headroom conditions are rounded downward.
Release tests pin the production profile, cover both History classes, exercise
optimizer boundaries and compare normative thresholds by exact integer
inequalities.

Subject to the fixed Poseidon2b delta, batch gate-depth price and scalar gate
charge premises stated in [the Category 1 proof](docs/category-one.md), the
resulting inequality bounds the success probability of every adversary inside
the declared resource envelope by less than one half in the from-genesis
invalid-State game.

This repository provides a Category 1 resource assessment for the Parano1d
soundness game. It does not claim that NIST reviewed or certified Parano1d.
