On Windows, `~` means the user profile directory.

`wallet.key` and `p2p_identity.key` are owner-only files on Unix. The first
controls funds; the second does not.

## Wallet artifact storage

`wallet.receipts` and `wallet.history` use checksummed local journals. A normal
save appends only changed receipts or the changed history suffix. Periodic
atomic snapshots compact obsolete records. The exported payment receipt and
all consensus formats are unchanged.

Existing JSON artifacts remain readable and migrate on their first save. The
original files are preserved as `wallet.receipts.legacy` and
`wallet.history.legacy`. These are pre-migration recovery copies, not current
backups. A conflicting existing recovery copy is never overwritten.

A JSON-only reader cannot read the journal format. Individual exported receipts
remain independent of this storage encoding. A master-secret backup alone does
not restore old receipts.

On startup, complete frames must pass checksum and schema checks. A partial
final append is reported and ignored without discarding earlier committed
frames. Missing initial snapshots and corrupted complete frames fail startup.
The next successful write repairs an incomplete tail. These checks protect
local storage integrity, not consensus validity or authorization to spend.

## Ports

| Port | Bind | Use | Public |
|---:|---|---|---|
| TCP 9600 | `0.0.0.0` | libp2p | Yes |
| TCP 9601 | `127.0.0.1` | JSON-RPC | No |

Remote external mining may use RPC only through a protected private or TLS
transport. A bearer token authenticates requests but does not encrypt them.

## Network identity

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Network | `mainnet` |
| Genesis block ID | `860e70453390bf815718e933aa4927167a13d098b0151391eefd722ee1add610` |
| Network magic | `NOID` |
| libp2p protocol | `/noid/mainnet/860e70453390bf81/1` |
| Transaction and block gossip | GossipSub |
| Discovery | DNS seeds, Kademlia, mDNS |

## Retention

| Data | Window |
|---|---:|
| Headers | Permanent |
| Canonical block bodies | 42 |
| Reorganizable suffix | 18 |
| Maximum reorganization | 17 |
| Undo records | 36 |
| Transaction epoch | 144 |

Receipts preserve payment-specific inclusion evidence outside body retention.
