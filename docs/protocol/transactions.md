# Transaction protocol

An ordinary user transaction is one canonical logical `PagedSpend`. It consists
of one to 128 fixed `Tx8x2` pages and exactly one detached authorization capsule.

## Physical page

Each page has the fixed 323-byte body encoding:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `epoch_anchor` | Current 144-block replay-protection anchor |
| `fee` | Logical fee on the first page; zero on continuations |
| `input_owner` | Owner shared by every live input |
| `inputs[8]` | Possible `{slot_index, amount, creation_id}` records |
| `outputs[2]` | Possible `{slot_index, amount, owner}` records |
| `validity_bitmap` | Live records and logical start/end markers |
| `is_coinbase` | False for every user page |

Bits 0–7 select inputs, 8–9 outputs, and 10–11 logical start/end.
V2 contract calls additionally use bit 12 (contract) and bit 13 (closing).
Ordinary payments leave these two bits zero; bits 14–15 are always zero.

A record whose live bit is zero must be the all-zero canonical dummy. This
removes alternate encodings of the same statement.

## Group validity

A valid `PagedSpend` satisfies all of these rules:

- page count is between one and 128;
- only page zero has the start marker;
- only the final page has the end marker;
- every page has the same `input_owner` and `epoch_anchor`;
- only the first page carries a non-zero fee;
- live inputs and outputs are packed densely in page order;
- the page count is minimal for those records;
- at least one input is live;
- no input appears twice;
- no output slot appears twice;
- an output slot is not also an input slot in the same spend;
- there are at most 504 inputs and 256 outputs, within the class page budget;
- total input value equals total output value plus the fee;
- the detached authorization is no larger than 256 KiB.

The maximum canonical intent encoding is 303,495 bytes.

Small permits 63 pages and Large 206 per block, with a shared 504-input
budget. A logical ordinary spend still has at most 128 pages and must fit in
one block. Wallet planning and both mempool admission checks enforce the
candidate height's limits. Format-only historical bounds are in the archive.

## Logical transaction ID

Page-local body hashes do not independently name the payment. The logical ID
is a domain-separated Poseidon2b sponge over:

```text
version || page_count || ordered_page_hashes
```

The launch version is `1`. Reordering, adding or removing a page changes the
ID. The authorization capsule proves knowledge of the preimage behind
`input_owner` for that exact logical ID.

## State checks

For each input, the current slot must be occupied by the declared owner,
amount and `creation_id`. For each output, the target slot must be empty and
inside the active slot domain.

Output `creation_id` values are not transaction fields. Consensus assigns them
from the post-State allocation sequence. A user cannot choose or reuse one.

The block transition enforces all State checks atomically for the complete
logical group.

## Fees

The minimum fee is:

```text
5,000
+ 100 × live_inputs
+ 700 × live_outputs
+ growth_price × max(0, live_outputs - live_inputs)
```

All amounts are in μNOID. `growth_price` begins at 2,500 μNOID per net-new
slot and is multiplied by 1, 2, 4 or 8 according to parent-State occupancy.

The State-growth component is burned. Any fee above the required minimum is a
miner-claimable tip. State-preserving and State-shrinking spends have no growth
burn.

## Epoch anchor

Every page uses the current transaction-epoch anchor. For child height `C`,
the anchor is the block ID at:

```text
floor((C - 1) / 144) × 144
```

for `C > 0`. Height 144 still consumes the height-zero anchor; height 145
begins using height 144. The mempool removes intents whose anchor is no longer
current.

## Authorization and State are separate

Wallet authorization proves ownership only. It does not prove current slot
membership and contains no Live State Merkle path.

The block `HistoryStep` proves current membership, emptiness, balance,
allocation and the post-State root. Both statements bind the same public
logical transaction.

## V2 contract calls

A call carries a 699-byte public opening and one canonical contract page.
It spends one exact `(slot_index, creation_id)` and checks the committed
program, selected authority and value policy. A continuing call creates an
updated commitment in output 0 and an optional payment in output 1. Closing
pays the branch recipient through output 0 and creates no successor.

Both classes support the same ABI and at most 63 calls. Calls share page and
input budgets with ordinary spends, forming the canonical user-page prefix.
The authorization proves the selected authority's secret; State ownership is
the opening's object commitment. See [contract core](../contracts/core.md)
and [lifecycle](../contracts/lifecycle.md) for the complete branch rules.

## System records

Primary reward and scheduled development payout records use the fixed physical
body type but are not user `PagedSpend` intents. Their shape, placement,
recipients and amounts are derived entirely from block context. They carry no
wallet authorization.

See [Transaction architecture](../architecture/transactions.md) for wallet and
mempool flow.
