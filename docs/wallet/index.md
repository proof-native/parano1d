# Wallet

The native wallet is a full-node application. It derives addresses, proves
spending authority, submits transactions, follows Live State, verifies blocks
and stores payment receipts on the same device.

Its bundled node is a private application component. The wallet starts it
without a terminal, communicates through local RPC and shuts it down cleanly
when the application exits.

Screenshots show the English wallet connected to an isolated v2 test network.
Addresses, balances and heights belong to that local test.

## Navigation

| Key | Section | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `F1` | Main | Active address, balances, UTXOs and Live State map |
| `F2` | Addresses | Derived addresses and active-owner selection |
| `F3` | Send | Build, prove and submit a payment |
| `F4` | Receipts | Saved outgoing receipts and independent verification |
| `F5` | Mining | Internal miner controls and mined blocks |
| `F6` | Scope | Search current State, blocks and retained transactions |
| `F7` | Contracts | Templates, saved contracts and contract receipts |
| `F8` | Settings | Secret, node, network and interface controls |
| `F10` | Quit | Stop the supervised node and close |

`Esc` returns from detail views and closes dialogs.

## Contracts

**F7** separates three contract
workflows:

- **Create**: choose a template or edit a custom program. The info button explains
  its rules and gives an example. **Create & fund** quotes the network fee and
  asks for confirmation; **Save without deposit** keeps the rules for later.
- **My contracts**: open a saved contract, check the active address's permissions,
  select a deposit and review an action. **Operations & receipts** tracks recent
  saved operations, including other participants' retained calls and imported
  receipts, and offers verified receipt export after confirmation.
  **Rules** shows the full spending policy and program.
- **Open file**: preview a shared contract or a call receipt. The node checks its
  rules, any attached proof and current balances before you explicitly add it.

**Share contract** saves the public rules with a matching verified receipt when
one is available. A receipt proves a past operation; current spendability is
checked separately. Each deposit has its own balance and program counters.
Creating identical rules does not give multiple deposits a shared budget.

Open contract files and operation receipts through **F7 → Open file**. Import
updates the existing contract by transaction ID, preserving your records and
local name; repeating an import does not duplicate the operation. A contract
file includes at most one receipt, not the sender's whole journal. Additional
missing operations need their own receipts. F4 **Receipts** handles ordinary
payments. If an offline wallet missed a call that peers have already pruned,
request updated terms or a call receipt from a participant to recover the new
counters and check their current balances.

**Call fee limit** caps the fee of a future call. The default 1 NOID is not a
creation charge: saving unfunded terms is free, and funding shows its own actual
network fee before confirmation.

The contract list and recent activity survive wallet restarts. The node retains
watched contract openings and call receipts; export files when sharing them
with another participant. Back up `wallet.contracts.json` and the
`contract-activity/` and complete `objects/` directories with the wallet data. Public contract rules and
saved proofs cannot be reconstructed from the master secret alone.

## The active address

One derived address is active at a time. It supplies:

- the owner used for a new payment's inputs;
- the address that receives change;
- the default internal-mining payout.

The wallet still scans and displays generated inactive addresses. It does not
silently combine their UTXOs into a payment from the active address.

## Local proving

When **Proof & Send** is selected, the form locks while the wallet constructs a
fresh authorization capsule. Mining CPU work yields to the local operation.
The secret never enters a transaction field or leaves the wallet process.

After successful submission, the final panel reports the logical transaction
ID and public payment facts. Confirmation is tracked by the node and the
wallet later saves a receipt.

## Local data

The default data directory is:

```text
~/.parano1d/data
```

on Linux and macOS, and the equivalent `.parano1d\data` directory under the
Windows user profile.

The master secret is stored in `wallet.key`. Saved receipts are stored in
`wallet.receipts`. Interface preferences are in
`~/.parano1d/gui-settings.json`.

The master-secret file is not password-encrypted. Protect the operating-system
account and back up the secret before receiving funds.
