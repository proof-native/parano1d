# Proof stack

Parano1d uses one binary arithmetic stack for ownership, State transitions,
Merkle relations, recursive continuity and proof of work commitments. The
committed trace field is the binary tower field `GF(2^128)`. The production
wide-challenge layer uses its quadratic extension `GF(2^256)`.

## Poseidon2b

Poseidon2b is the common permutation:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---:|
| State width | 4 field elements |
| S-box | `x^7` |
| Full rounds | 8 |
| Partial rounds | 58 |

Typed domain tags separate addresses, physical pages, logical transactions,
Merkle nodes, State commitments, block identifiers, PoW digests and proof
transcripts. Sharing a permutation does not mean sharing a hash domain.

## [FROST-GKR](../research/frost-gkr.md)

The protocol expresses batched Poseidon2b executions and Merkle paths as direct
degree-seven relations over shared Boolean hypercubes. It is the committed-
column reduction used by Parano1d, not a layer-by-layer replay of a circuit.

The reduction keeps the multilinear-extension and sumcheck machinery of GKR
while replacing recursive circuit-layer descent with global relations over
the execution trace. Shared columns let many permutations and paths be checked
without paying for an independent constraint sumcheck for every instance.

## Closing the relation

The downstream pipeline combines:

- batched sumcheck;
- zerocheck;
- lincheck;
- FRI-Binius/BaseFold over the binary field;
- one joint `GF(2^256)` transcript for the three Link and six Block recursive
  regions.

The transparent proof system uses an authenticated joint Small/Large bank.
Its pins bind the interpreter, resource budgets and activation schedule.
Contract programs execute in this shared relation. The transition release
also verifies historical ancestry; a later retired-history release can use
authenticated origin certificates without embedding old matrix bytes.

## Wallet authorization

The wallet proves knowledge of the 256-bit preimage behind `input_owner`,
bound to the logical transaction ID. The proof is freshly randomized and
witness-hiding. It contains no State path.

The serialized authorization has a 92,696-byte worst-case bound. The wire
format permits up to 256 KiB so decoding remains explicitly bounded while
leaving room for the canonical proof object.

Contract inputs use the same secret-knowledge proof for the authority selected
by their committed policy; the State owner is the object commitment.

## HistoryStep

The block prover establishes the complete public transition and verifies the
previous terminal inside the new relation. The next terminal therefore binds:

```text
previous validity
        +
current block relation
        +
exact post-State
```

Proof size and terminal verification do not grow with chain height. Permanent
headers remain outside recursion for proof-of-work accumulation and fork
choice.

## Security accounting

C1 uses 65 wallet queries and 133 History queries. The v2 calculation includes
old ancestry and both matrix-retirement reductions. Its exact inventory,
composition premises and Category 1 resource bounds are in the
[security model](../protocol/security-model.md). Contract programs add
deterministic constraints inside the shared relation.
