# Size and admission limits relevant to v2 capacity

Audit updated September 25, 2026. Existing transaction, block and terminal
limits remain unchanged. V2 adds a separately bounded fork-origin protocol.
Fitting m23 does not imply fitting transport, and fitting bytes does not imply
that the production node accepts the research v2 protocol.

| Boundary | Current limit | Implication |
|---|---:|---|
| Serialized v1.1 terminal | 1,100,000 bytes | Terminal only; separate from the body. |
| Expanded v1.1 terminal decode | 1,100,000 bytes | Shared-path compression does not permit an oversized expanded proof. |
| Canonical block body | 82,905 bytes | 212-byte header, marker/count and 256 fixed 323-byte pages. |
| Accepted bundle including framing | 1,182,917 bytes | 12-byte framing + body cap + terminal cap. |
| Exact-object response payload | 1,100,000 bytes total | Body and terminal can require separate responses even when each fits. |
| Exact objects requested together | 8 | A count limit, not permission to send eight maximum-size terminals. |
| One wallet authorization bundle | 262,144 bytes | Enforced separately from the containing transaction intent. |
| PagedSpend intent | 303,495 bytes | Up to 128 pages belonging to one logical transaction plus authorization. |
| ABI 3 object intent | 263,181 bytes | One page, its opening and authorization; fits the existing global intent cap. |
| Active GossipSub message size | 303,495 bytes | Configured from maximum intent/header announce size; not the unused 2 MiB constant. |
| Mempool | 1,024 transactions / 384 MiB | Burst/backlog limits, separate from block capacity. |
| Mempool-sync response | 128 transactions / 16 MiB | Both bounds apply. |
| P2P response allocation budgets | 64 MiB inbound and 64 MiB outbound | Concurrency cannot multiply payload memory without bound. |
| Fork-origin certificate | 48 MiB | Separate protocol, sharing the same process-wide response allocation budgets. |
| Block resource weight | 64 MiB | Includes weighted transaction, input, output and frontier work; not just wire bytes. |
| User pages / live inputs / user outputs | 255 / 1,020 / 510 | Existing native global limits; research profiles impose tighter page/input limits. |
| Distinct State segments in one block | 256 | A high-TPS candidate must include distributed State cases. |
| Snapshot tail staging | 4,096 bodies / 512 MiB | A separate catch-up backlog bound. |

## Candidate formats and integration

The earlier single-class [research codec](../../noid_recursive/src/acceptance/history_step/v2/wire.rs)
uses version 6. It is not the scheduled node format. The
[joint codec](../../noid_recursive/src/acceptance/history_step/v2/banked/wire.rs)
uses version 7 and derives its decoding bound from the pinned runtime.
The [shared metadata decoder](../../noid_chain/src/history_step.rs) now selects
4/5/7 by terminal height, with two valid class ids after the v2 boundary.
Pre-fork formats and their metadata class range are preserved.

The joint candidate's terminal bounds are 1,014,132 bytes for m23 and
1,081,396 bytes for m24. Both fit 1,100,000 bytes, but the existing exact-object
response budget may require fetching the body and terminal separately.
The [full-node capacity run](results/2026-09-25-live-full-capacity/REPORT.md)
exercised both classes over P2P, including a full B255 body and the small-block
tail. Historical single-class receiver reports retain their recorded rejection
of version 6; those reports describe a different format.

The [fork-origin codec](../../noid_p2p/src/fork_origin.rs) acquires a shared memory
permit before allocating its payload and retains the permit through consumption.
It bounds request concurrency and serves certificates outside the control loop.
Its request hash is a lookup key; only proof verification authenticates an origin.
The first [retirement check](results/2026-09-25-fork-origin/REPORT.md) covers an
old B25-only boundary. The [cold-sync scenario](results/2026-09-25-retired-cold-sync/REPORT.md)
also exercises transport, offline restart and same-tip certificate recovery.
It retains the same B25-only legacy-origin scope.
The [both-class component run](results/2026-09-25-full-legacy-origin/REPORT.md)
measured a 15,093,850-byte certificate and 1,429 ms certificate verification
on four PCLMUL CPUs. The [daemon continuation](results/2026-09-25-retired-production/REPORT.md)
also cold-synchronized through P2P and produced a contract block without old
matrices, within an 8 GiB node envelope. Four-CPU PCLMUL proving took 76–79 s;
it is not a 30-second mining-capacity result.

For 112 independent one-page payments, the body is 36,716 bytes. At 223 and 255
such payments it would be 72,569 and 82,905 bytes. The measured proof sizes and
runtime-derived bounds are in the [capacity report](results/2026-09-24-tps/REPORT.md).
An optimized block relation must account for all terminal proof bytes, including
its internal GKR proofs. Reducing the outer row count while making the terminal
oversized would not qualify a candidate.

## Integration requirements after a proof design is selected

Keep admission height-aware across terminal metadata, the bundle constructor,
object and terminal codecs, persistence and snapshot/catch-up readers. Check
serialized and expanded maxima before allocation. Preserve pre-fork decoding and
exercise exact limits, one byte over, malicious length tables and truncated
encodings. Check combined body/terminal responses and the split-response path.

The [network profile](../../noid_p2p/src/network_profile.rs) deliberately retains
a pre-v1.1 baseline of 1 MiB/version 4 in its identity, while active admission
uses the height-selected cap and encoding. Changing those advertised fields
without a transition design could disconnect nodes before activation. They are
not an overlooked active 1 MiB terminal cap.

Measure propagation, mempool authorization traffic, bounded verifier queues and
catch-up concurrently on 4 CPU / 8 GiB. A successful local proof or a byte-size
comparison alone does not qualify these paths. Any necessary limit change must
be tied to the selected fork rules and tested with old/new nodes before and
after the boundary.
